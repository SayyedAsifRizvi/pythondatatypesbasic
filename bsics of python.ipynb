    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in the late 1980s. He developed Python as a hobby project while working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. The first version of Python was released in 1991, and since then, it has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. Guido van Rossum continued to lead the development of Python until he retired in 2018. Today, Python is developed and maintained by a large community of developers around the world."
