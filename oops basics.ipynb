    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the technique of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the necessary information through a public interface. It helps to protect the object's data from being modified or accessed in unintended ways, and promotes modular and scalable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of defining a simplified representation of a complex system or entity. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces, which define a common set of methods and properties that can be implemented by concrete classes. Abstraction helps to reduce complexity and increase code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a new class is created by inheriting properties and behaviors from an existing class. The existing class is called the parent or base class, and the new class is called the child or derived class. Inheritance promotes code reusability, reduces code duplication, and enables polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms or behaviors. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a derived class to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class, while method overloading allows a class to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Polymorphism enables flexibility and extensibility in code design.\n",
