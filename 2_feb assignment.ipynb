    "### Q1. What are the characteristics of the tuples? Is tuple immutable?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Answer -In Python, tuples are an ordered, immutable, and heterogeneous collection of elements. Some of the main characteristics of tuples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Order: Tuples maintain the order of the elements that they contain, meaning that the position of each element is fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Immutable: Tuples are immutable, which means that their elements cannot be changed once they have been created. This makes tuples an effective way of representing constant values that should not be altered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types, making them more flexible than other data structures like lists, which typically contain elements of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexed: Tuples can be accessed by index, just like lists, making it easy to retrieve specific elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packing and Unpacking: Tuples can be created by packing elements together, and they can be unpacked into separate variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashable: Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, because they are hashable and their values are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient: Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists because they have a fixed size and do not require resizing when elements are added or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, tuples are a useful data structure in Python for representing small, fixed-size collections of related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, tuples in Python are immutable. This means that once you create a tuple, you cannot modify its elements. You can access elements in a tuple using indexing, but you cannot change the values of the elements or add or remove elements from the tuple. This immutability is one of the key differences between tuples and lists in Python, which are mutable data structures. The immutability of tuples can be useful for representing values that should not change, such as constant data or items that you want to hash for use as a key in a dictionary."

    "### Q2. What are the two tuple methods in python? Give an example of each method. Give a reason why tuples have only two in-built methods as compared to Lists.\n",
    "Tuples have only two built-in methods in Python, which are count and index.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. count method: This method takes an element as an argument and returns the number of times the element appears in the tuple. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)\n",
    " \n",
    " t.count(2)\n",
    " \n",
    " 2\n",
    "\n",
    "2. index method: This method takes an element as an argument and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element in the tuple. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    " t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)\n",
    " \n",
    " t.index(3)\n",
    " \n",
    " 2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that tuples have only two built-in methods compared to lists is because tuples are meant to be simple, efficient data structures for representing small, fixed collections of values. The limited number of methods reflects this design philosophy by providing only the most essential methods for working with tuples. In contrast, lists are meant to be more flexible data structures that can be used for a wider range of tasks, so they have a larger number of built-in methods.\n"
